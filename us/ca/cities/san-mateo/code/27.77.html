                <p>This policy is intended to represent minimum standards of aesthetic suitability and to establish minimum standards for development of service stations in the City of San Mateo.</p>
                <p>Meeting these design review standards shall not be construed as a sole justification for the granting of a special permit. All other requirements of the zoning ordinance must be met for review and consideration by the Planning Commission. Any action by the Planning Commission is subject to review by the City Council.</p>
