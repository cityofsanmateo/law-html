The provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40" title="Chapter 23.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT CODE">this chapter</a> shall apply to all site development on private property within the City as delineated in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40.030" title="23.40.030 REQUIRED APPROVALS.">Section 23.40.030</a> and may also be used for review of public projects that require a planning application and public review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Purpose. <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40" title="Chapter 23.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT CODE">This chapter</a> is adopted to promote public health and safety and general public welfare, and specifically to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Protect public and private lands from erosion, earth movement, flooding, and ensure the maximum preservation of the natural scenic character of the City by establishing minimum standards and requirements relating to land grading, excavations and fills, and removal of major vegetation by establishing procedures by which these standards and requirements may be enforced;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Ensure that the development of each site relates to adjacent lands so as to maximize visually pleasant relationships and minimize physical problems which could result in increased development or maintenance costs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Regulate development on or near steep slopes in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare and preserve the natural setting of the hillsides. Minimize the risk of personal injury, damage to property, and impact on water quality from potential landslides, erosion, earth creep, stormwater runoff, and other hazards associated with hillside areas of the City. Preserve existing topographical forms, open spaces, habitat areas and visual resources from encroachment by new hillside development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Interpretation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> In their interpretation and application, provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40" title="Chapter 23.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT CODE">this chapter</a> shall be held to be minimum requirements, except where they are expressly stated to be maximum requirements. It is not intended to impair, or interfere with any private restrictions placed upon property by covenant or deed; provided, however, that where <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40" title="Chapter 23.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT CODE">this chapter</a> imposes higher standards or a greater restriction upon the development of land than are imposed or required by such private restrictions, the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40" title="Chapter 23.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT CODE">this chapter</a> shall control.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> Whenever any provision of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40" title="Chapter 23.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT CODE">this chapter</a> and any other provisions of law, whether set forth in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40" title="Chapter 23.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT CODE">this chapter</a> or in any other law, ordinance or resolution of any kind, impose overlapping or contradictory regulations over the development of land, or contain any restrictions covering any of the same subject matter, that provision which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards or requirements shall govern.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> Whenever <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.40" title="Chapter 23.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT CODE">this chapter</a> grants authority to the City Engineer, Building Official or Director of Parks and Recreation, that official may delegate such authority to a designee.</p>

Failure of the City officials to observe or recognize hazardous or scarring conditions which may adversely affect the economic value of other property in the vicinity, or to recommend denial of a site development planning application or of a site development permit, shall not relieve the permittee for responsibility for the condition or damages resulting therefrom, and shall not result in the City, its officers or agents, being responsible for the conditions or damages resulting therefrom.</p>
