                <p>Prior to submittal of the annual budget, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council the fees proposed for the next fiscal year.

If the proposed fees represent a percentage increase exceeding the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, they must be approved by the Council before becoming effective. Notwithstanding the above, the Council may amend any fee at any time.</p>
