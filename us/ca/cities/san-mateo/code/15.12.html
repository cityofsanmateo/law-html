Said procedure shall be had until such franchise is struck off, sold and awarded to a bidder who shall make the necessary deposit of at least ten percent of his or her bid therefor, as herein provided. Such successful bidder shall deposit with the City Clerk, within twenty-four hours of acceptance of his or her bid, the remaining ninety percent of the amount thereof, and in case he or she has then failed to do so, then such deposit theretofore made, shall be forfeited, and such award of such franchise shall be void, and such franchise shall then and there by council be again offered for sale to the highest bidder or bidders therefor, in the same manner, and under the same restrictions as hereinbefore provided, and in case such bidder has failed to deposit with the City Clerk the remaining ninety percent of his or her bid within twenty-four hours after its acceptance, the award to him or her shall be forfeited, and no further proceedings for a sale of such franchise shall be had, unless the same is readvertised and again offered for sale, in the manner hereinbefore provided.</p>
