                <p>Any person engaged in activities, which will or may result in pollutants entering the City storm drain system shall undertake all practicable measures to reduce such pollutants. Examples of such activities include ownership and use of facilities which may be a source of pollutants such as parking lots, gasoline stations, industrial facilities, commercial facilities, stores fronting city streets, etc. The following minimal requirements shall apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Littering. No person shall throw, deposit, leave, maintain, keep, or permit to be thrown, deposited, placed, left or maintained, any refuse, rubbish, garbage, or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles, and accumulations, in or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, storm drain, inlet, catch basin, conduit or other drainage structures, business place, or upon any public or private lot of land in the City, so that the same might be or become a pollutant, except in containers or in lawfully established dumping grounds. The occupant or tenant, or in the absence of occupant or tenant, the owner, lessee, or proprietor of any real property in the City of San Mateo in front of which there is a paved sidewalk shall maintain said sidewalk free of dirt or litter to the maximum extent practicable. Debris from said sidewalk shall not be swept or otherwise made or allowed to go into the gutter or roadway, but shall be disposed of in receptacles maintained on said real property as required for the disposal of garbage. No person shall throw or deposit litter in any fountain, pond, lake, stream or any other body of water in a park or elsewhere within the City.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Standards for Parking Lots and Similar Structures. Persons owning or operating a parking lot, gas station pavement or similar structure shall clean those structures as frequently and thoroughly as practicable in a manner that does not result in discharge of pollutants to the City storm drain system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Best Management Practices for New Developments and Redevelopments. Any construction contractor performing work in the City shall endeavor, to provide filter materials at the catch basin to retain any debris and dirt flowing in to the City's storm drain system. The Director of Public Works may establish controls on the volume and rate of stormwater runoff from new developments and redevelopments as may be appropriate to minimize the discharge and transport of pollutants.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Compliance with Best Management Practices. Where best management practices guidelines or requirements have been adopted by the City for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to stormwater pollution or contamination, illicit discharges, and/or discharge of non-stormwater to the stormwater system, every person undertaking such activity or operation, or owning or operating such facility shall comply with such guidelines or requirements (as may be identified by the Director of Public Works).</p>
