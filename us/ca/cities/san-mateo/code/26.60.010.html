The scale of the plans and the size of the sheets shall be subject to approval by the City engineer.

The City engineer shall be furnished with such samples or materials as he or she may require for making tests to determine the acceptability of such materials. Prior to beginning the work on all or any portion of a subdivision, or prior to filing the final map with the Council, the subdivider shall deposit with the City an amount equal to the estimated actual cost for the inspection of the work and the cost of checking materials for said improvements during the entire period of construction of said subdivision or portion thereof. If the amount so deposited exceeds the actual cost to the City, the subdivider shall be reimbursed the balance of the deposit. Should the actual cost exceed the deposited amount, the City engineer shall stop all construction until the subdivider shall present a receipt for a deposit with the City of such additional sum as the City engineer may estimate.</p>
