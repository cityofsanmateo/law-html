                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Application for an equitable adjustment in the sewer service charge may be made at any other time during the year. Such an application shall be supported by documented factual information; and shall be filed with the Director of Public Works.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> An application for an equitable adjustment in the sewer service charge may be approved by the Director of Public Works if the Director finds that the application conclusively demonstrates by written documentation that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> The applicant's water system was ruptured;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The rupture caused the reported water flow for one or more of the months designated in Section 3.54.030 to be abnormally high; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> The applicant effected repairs that corrected the rupture within a reasonable period of time; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> The applicant became the owner and occupant of the residential property after the consumption period used to calculate the charge in Section 3.54.030 and the average water consumption during the following year for the period used to calculate the charge is lower than the previous year's consumption period by at least 25 percent; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> The applicant's customer classification is incorrect. Such applicant will be required to provide a written request documenting the basis for the change in customer classification. The request must be supported by proof that the current classification is incorrect. Such proof may require a supporting study of the claimant's business operations including water use, return of water to sewer system, water diverted for irrigation and/or any other information required to support the basis for a change in classification. A study will not be required if a clear mistake in classification has occurred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Any refund granted due to an equitable adjustment as provided in subsection (e) and such refund is processed through the County shall be subject to the transaction fee charged by the County of San Mateo in effect at the time the adjustment is granted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> If an adjustment is approved by the Director of Public Works after the roll has been closed and collection made from the applicant for the adjustment, the City shall make the adjustment by refunding the amount of the adjustment to the applicant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The decision of the Director of Public Works may be appealed to the City Manager. The decision of the City Manager shall be final.</p>
