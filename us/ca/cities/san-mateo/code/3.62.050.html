                <p>The leasing, sale, or disposition of City property will be governed by the following procedures:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Personal Property. All personal property having value only as scrap may be accumulated to be sold as a lot for the highest bid. Said bid may be made and honored for a calendar year, or less, as the City Manager may determine. All other personal property may be sold at an auction or by advertising for bids in accordance with either the "Council Award Procedure" or the "Manager Award Procedure" set forth in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.60" title="Chapter 3.60 PURCHASING">Chapter 3.60</a>, depending on the awarding authority. By 4/5 vote of the City Council bids may be waived if: (1) disposition is made to a non-profit entity provided that the Council finds the disposition to be of public benefit; or (2) if the property is of a type for which there is no otherwise available market. Used and unneeded computers and computer equipment may be donated to schools within the City of San Mateo without compliance with this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Real Property. The bid provisions of the "Council Award Procedure" set forth in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.60" title="Chapter 3.60 PURCHASING">Chapter 3.60</a> will apply to the sale of City real property. Leasing of City real property is subject to the bid provisions of the "Council Award Procedure" or the "Manager Award Procedure" set forth in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.60" title="Chapter 3.60 PURCHASING">Chapter 3.60</a>, depending on the awarding authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Award and Rejection. The awarding authority may, in its discretion, waive any informalities or minor irregularities in the bids or quotations received. In determining to whom the award is to be made, the awarding authority may consider, in addition to the bid or quotation received, the experience of the bidder for the particular service sought, the quality of work that the bidder has done, the quality of the product provided by the bidder, the ability of the bidder to complete the project in a timely manner, the safety compliance record of the bidder, and the insurance carrier by the bidder.</p>
