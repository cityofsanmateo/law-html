                <p>The City Council finds that adult entertainment businesses, because of their very nature, are recognized as having objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation of these businesses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods. The primary purpose of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.63" title="Chapter 27.63 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES">this chapter</a> is to prevent the concentration or clustering of these businesses in any one area.</p>
