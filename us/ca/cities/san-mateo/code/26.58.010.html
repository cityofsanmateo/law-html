The proposed adjustment shall not be approved if any public utility easements or rights-of-way will be adversely affected without the consent of the affected utilities or agencies. The City Engineer shall also consider whether the proposed adjustment will adversely affect access to any affected parcel and condition the adjustment to ensure that access is adequately preserved. When the City Engineer is satisfied that the drawing, as it may be corrected by the applicant, meets the applicable requirements of this Code, the City Engineer will indicate his or her approval or conditional approval on the drawing and forward the drawing to the Director of Community Development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The Director of Community Development will then review the drawing for conformity with all other applicable provisions of this code. The Director of Community Development may either approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the proposed adjustment. He or she shall so indicate on the drawing and shall send it to the City Engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> If the proposed adjustment is approved, or conditionally approved, the applicant shall then meet with the City Engineer or his or her designee to determine the scope and standards of survey, if any, to be used and shall then submit the following documentation to the City Engineer.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> The Director of Community Development will then review the materials submitted, and if they meet with his or her approval, he or she will approve them by signing the certificate and return them to the City Engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(8)">(8)</span> The City Engineer shall then cause the lot line adjustment to be recorded with the County Recorder. The applicants shall pay all costs of delivery and recordation.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> Approval of the drawing as described above shall satisfy any requirement for a tentative parcel map pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26.56" title="Chapter 26.56 PARCEL MAPS">Chapter 26.56</a>. If the drawing is approved or conditionally approved by the Director of Community Development, the applicant shall then submit the final parcel map with the required checklist and fee to the City Engineer for processing as follows. No tentative parcel map will be required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> The City Engineer shall then review and process the final parcel map pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26.56" title="Chapter 26.56 PARCEL MAPS">Chapter 26.56</a> of this Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> A final decision of the Director of Community Development or the City Engineer under this Section may be appealed to the Planning Commission pursuant to Section 27.08.070(a).</p>
