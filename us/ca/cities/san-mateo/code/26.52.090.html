                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Filing. Upon receipt of the final map and related documents, the City Clerk will put the matter on an agenda of a regular Council meeting for acceptance and filing that is no more than fifteen (15) days after the filing of the final subdivision map with the City Clerk.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Agreements. In the event that the improvements required under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26" title="Title 26 SUBDIVISIONS">this Title</a> have not been installed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer at the time of the filing of the final map for any or all of the portions of a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall file with the City Clerk at the time of filing the final map with the City Clerk an executed agreement between the subdivider and the City specifying the period within which the subdivider shall complete all improvements and work to the satisfaction of the City. The agreement shall also prescribe that the subdivider shall repair any damage to public roads, streets, and any other public property or improvements that results from, or is incidental to, the construction of the improvements in the subdivision, or in lieu of making such repairs, the subdivider shall pay to the owner of the damaged property or improvements the full cost of repair and restoration.</p>
                <p>Such an agreement shall also include a performance bond or other improvement security, a labor and materials bond and evidence of insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, and workers compensation in the form and in the amounts generally required of all agreements for public improvements entered into by the City.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Additional Deeds. At the time of the filing of the final map with the City Clerk, the subdivider shall also provide grant deeds for any land or easements required as a part of the subdivision that are not dedicated on the final map itself.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions. At the time of filing the final map with the City Clerk, the subdivider shall also provide the City Clerk with verification that any conditions, covenants, and restrictions to be recorded with the final map have been reviewed by the City Attorney for conformance with City approval conditions, when such conditions expressly require review by the City Attorney.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Council Action. The Council shall take action on the final map at either the meeting before which the Clerk has placed the matter or the next regular Council meeting. The Council will approve the map if it conforms to the tentative map and all applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26" title="Title 26 SUBDIVISIONS">this Title</a>. The time limit for action may be extended by mutual agreement of the City and the subdivider. Concurrently with the approval of the final map, the Council will accept or reject such offers of dedication as it deems advisable, and as a condition precedent to the acceptance of any property interests, shall require the subdivider to either improve or agree in writing to improve such interests in the subdivision.</p>
